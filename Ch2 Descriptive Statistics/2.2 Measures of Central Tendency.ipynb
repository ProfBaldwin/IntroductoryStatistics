    "## Mean and Median ##\n",
    "The \"center\" of a data set is also a way of describing location. The two most widely used measures of the \"center\" of the data are the **mean** (average) and the **median**. To calculate the mean weight of 50 people, add the 50 weights together and divide by 50. To find the median weight of the 50 people, order the data and find the number that splits the data into two equal parts. The median is generally a better measure of the center when there are extreme values or outliers because it is not affected by the precise numerical values of the outliers. The mean is the most common measure of the center.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** The words “mean” and “average” are often used interchangeably. The substitution of one word for the other is common practice. The technical term is “arithmetic mean” and “average” is technically a center location. However, in practice among non-statisticians, “average\" is commonly accepted for “arithmetic mean.”\n",
    "\n",
    "When each value in the data set is not unique, the mean can be calculated by multiplying each distinct value by its frequency and then dividing the sum by the total number of data values. The letter used to represent the sample mean is an x with a bar over it (pronounced “x bar”): $\\bar{x}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Greek letter $\\mu$ (pronounced \"mew\" and spelled in English \"mu\") represents the population mean. One of the requirements for the sample mean to be a good estimate of the population mean is for the sample taken to be truly random.\n",
