    "Given two events $A$ and $B$, we would like to know how to calculate $P(A\\text{ OR }B)$, the probability that the outcome is in event $A$ or in event $B$. We know the probability that the outcome is in event $A$ is $P(A)$ and the probability that the outcome is in event $B$ is $P(B)$, so it may be reasonable to conclude that we can calculate $P(A\\text{ OR }B)$ by simply adding $P(A)$ and $P(B)$. But this isn't quite right.\n",

We count the set of shared outcomes $A\\text{ AND }B$ once when we calculate $P(A)$, then *again* when we calculate $P(B)$, meaning we count the probability of the outcomes in $A\\text{ AND }B$ *twice*. We only want to count each outcome *once*. To correct this, we need to subtract the excess: since we counted $P(A\\text{ AND }B)$ twice instead of just once, we need to subtract $P(A\\text{ AND }B)$ once to remove the excess. This gives us our **addition rule**:\n",
