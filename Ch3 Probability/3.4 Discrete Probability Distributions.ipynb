Recall that probability does not describe the short-term results of an experiment. It gives information about what can be expected in the long term. To demonstrate this, Karl Pearson once tossed a fair coin 24,000 times! He recorded the results of each toss, obtaining heads 12,012 times. **In his experiment, Pearson illustrated the Law of Large Numbers**.\n",

When evaluating the long-term results of statistical experiments, we often want to know the “average” outcome. This “long-term average” is known as the **mean** or **expected value** of the experiment and is denoted by the Greek letter $\\mu$.
