    "There are three characteristics of a binomial experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "- There are a fixed number of trials. Think of trials as repetitions of an experiment. The letter n denotes the number of trials.\n",
    "- There are only two possible outcomes, called \"success\" and \"failure,\" for each trial. The letter $p$ denotes the probability of a success on one trial, and $q$ denotes the probability of a failure on one trial. $p + q = 1$.\n",
    "- The $n$ trials are independent and are repeated using identical conditions. Because the $n$ trials are independent, the outcome of one trial does not help in predicting the outcome of another trial. Another way of saying this is that for each individual trial, the probability, $p$, of a success and probability, $q$, of a failure remain the same. For example, randomly guessing at a true-false statistics question has only two outcomes. If a success is guessing correctly, then a failure is guessing incorrectly. Suppose Joe always guesses correctly on any statistics true-false question with probability $p = 0.6$. Then, $q = 0.4$. This means that for every true-false statistics question Joe answers, his probability of success ($p = 0.6$ and his probability of failure ($q = 0.4$) remain the same.\n",
    "The outcomes of a binomial experiment fit a **binomial probability distribution**, which is a special kind of discrete probability distribution. The random variable $X$ = the number of successes obtained in the $n$ independent trials.\n",
    "\n",
    "The mean, $\\mu$, and variance, $\\sigma^2$, for the binomial probability distribution are $\\mu = np$ and $\\sigma^2 = npq$. The standard deviation, $\\sigma$, is then $\\sigma =  \\sqrt{npq}$."

A \"success\" could be defined as an individual who withdrew. The random variable $X$ = the number of students who withdraw from the randomly selected elementary physics class. The probability of success is $p = 0.30$ and the probability of failure is $q = 0.70$.
