    "## The Central Limit Theorem\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose $X$ is a random variable with a distribution that may be known or unknown (it can be *any* distribution). Using a subscript that matches the random variable, suppose:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $\\mu_X$ = the mean of $X$\n",
    "- $\\sigma_X$ = the standard deviation of $X$\n",
    "\n",
    "If you draw random samples of size n, then as n increases, the random variable $\\overline{X}$  which consists of sample means, tends to be **normally distributed** and\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\overline{X} \\sim N\\left(\\mu_X, \\frac{\\sigma_X}{\\sqrt{n}}\\right). $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The **central limit theorem** for sample means says that if you keep drawing larger and larger samples (such as rolling one, two, five, and finally, ten dice) and **calculating their means,** the sample means form their own **normal distribution** (the sampling distribution). The normal distribution has the same mean as the original distribution and a variance that equals the original variance divided by the sample size. Standard deviation is the square root of variance, so the standard deviation of the sampling distribution is the standard deviation of the original distribution divided by the square root of $n$. The variable $n$ is the number of values that are averaged together, not the number of times the experiment is done.\n",
    "\n",
    "To put it more formally, if you draw random samples of size $n$, the distribution of the random variable  $\\overline{X}$, which consists of sample means, is called the sampling distribution of the mean. The sampling distribution of the mean approaches a normal distribution as $n$, the sample size, increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "The random variable  $\\overline{X}$  has a different $z$-score associated with it from that of the random variable $X$. The mean  $\\bar{x}$  is the value of  $\\overline{X}$ in one sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ z = \\frac{\\bar{x} - \\mu_{\\overline{X}}}{\\sigma_{\\overline{X}}} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\mu_X$ is the average of both $X$ and $\\overline{X}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\sigma_{\\overline{X}} = \\frac{\\sigma_X}{\\sqrt{n}}$ = standard deviation of $\\overline{X}$ and is called the **standard error of the mean**.\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate this principle, consider a fair six-sided die. Since each outcome is equally likely, the expected value of rolling the die is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\mu_X = \\frac{1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6}{6} = 3.5. $$\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also calculate that the population standard deviation is $\\sigma_X = 1.7078$.\n",
    "\n",
    "What does this mean? If we roll a die once, we certainly don't expect to get 3.5. But if we roll the die several times, we expect the average of those rolls to be reasonably close to 3.5. The more times we roll the die, the closer we expect the average of those rolls to be to 3.5. The Central Limit Theorem is the formal mathematical statement of this concept. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Central Limit Theorem tells us exactly how likely or unlikely getting an average from a sample is. Imagine we roll a die 50 times; that is, we \"sample\" 50 rolls. The Central Limit Theorem tells us that the means of *all* possible samples of 50 rolls form the normal distribution $\\overline{X} \\sim N(3.5, 1.7078/\\sqrt{50})$. We can use this to determine how likely or unlikely it is to randomly select a sample with a certain mean."
