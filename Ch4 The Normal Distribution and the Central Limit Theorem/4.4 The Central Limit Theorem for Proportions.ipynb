    "## Population Proportions\n",
    "\n",
    "A **population proportion** is the fraction, ratio, or percentage of the population that possesses a certain characteristic. For example, in 2006, the **proportion** of adult Americans that were married was 55.7%. Note a few important properties about proportions:\n",
    " \n",
    "- For each member of the population, there are only two options: either the member possesses the characteristic or the member doesn't possess the characteristic. In the above example, since 55.7% of U.S. adults were married in 2006, we can conclude that 100% - 55.7% = 44.3% of U.S. adults were not married in 2006.\n",
    "- The value of a proportion is always between 0 and 1. In the above example, the proportion 55.7% = 0.557 lies between 0 and 1.\n",
    "- A proportion is the probability that, if we randomly select a member of the population, that the selected member will possess the characteristic. In the example above, if we were to randomly select an adult in the year 2006, there is a 55.7% chance that the selected adult would be married.\n",
    "\n",
    "A population proportion $p$ is calculated using the formula\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ p = \\frac{x}{N}, $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $x$ is the number of individuals in the population with the desired characteristic and $N$ is the size of the population.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if we knew that Menifee High School had 4,582 students, 1,231 of whom were freshman, the proportion of freshman in the population of Menifee High School students is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$p = \\frac{x}{N} = \\frac{1,231}{4,582} = 0.2687.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So 26.87% of all Menifee High School students are freshman."

We might naturally ask the same question of proportions: If we take a sample from a population, can we expect the sample proportion to be close to the population proportion?\n",

    "### Example 4.4.1\n",
    "A poll is conducted of 1,000 Americans to determine whether or not they approve of the President of the United States. Suppose that, in reality, 54% of all Americans approve of the President.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What is the probability that fewer than 50% of those polled approve of the President?\n",

    "#### Solution\n",
    "First, note that the sample size is $n = 1,000$ and the population proportion is $p = 0.54$. Then by the Central Limit Theorem, we know that the sample proportions or normally distributed with mean\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\mu_{P'} = p = 0.54 $$\n",
