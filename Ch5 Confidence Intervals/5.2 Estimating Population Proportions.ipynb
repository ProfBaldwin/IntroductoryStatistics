    "## Introduction\n",
    "During an election year, we see articles in the newspaper that state **confidence intervals** in terms of proportions or percentages. For example, a poll for a particular candidate running for president might show that the candidate has 40% of the vote with a margin of error of three percentage points (if the sample is large enough). Often, election polls are calculated with 95% confidence, so, the pollsters would be 95% confident that the true proportion of voters who favored the candidate would be between 0.37 and 0.43: (0.40 â€“ 0.03,0.40 + 0.03).\n",
    "\n",
    "Investors in the stock market are interested in the true proportion of stocks that go up and down each week. Businesses that sell personal computers are interested in the proportion of households in the United States that own personal computers. Confidence intervals can be calculated for the true proportion of stocks that go up or down each week and for the true proportion of households in the United States that own personal computers."

    "## Calculating the Confidence Interval\n",
    "\n",
    "The procedure to find the confidence interval, the sample size, the **margin of error**, and the **confidence level** for a proportion is similar to that for the population mean, but the formulas are different.\n",
    "\n",
    "We know from the Central Limit Theorem that the distributions of sample proportions is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P' \\sim N\\left(p, \\sqrt{\\frac{p(1 - p)}{n}}\\right), $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $p$ is the population proportion and $n$ is the sample size. Of course, as in the case with means, if we already knew the value of the population proportion $p$, we wouldn't be estimating it using a confidence interval. We approximate the population proportion $p$ with the point estimate $p'$. Then to construct a confidence interval, we will use the distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ N\\left(p', \\sqrt{\\frac{p'(1 - p')}{n}}\\right) $$\n",

    "$$ (p' - E, p' + E), $$\n",
