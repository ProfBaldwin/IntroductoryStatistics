    "## The Null and Alternative Hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "A hypothesis test begins by considering two **hypotheses**. They are called the **null hypothesis** and the **alternative hypothesis**. These hypotheses contain opposing viewpoints.\n",
    "\n",
    "$H_0$: **The null hypothesis**: It is the claim about the population mean $\\mu$ or population proportion $p$. After sampling the population and obtaining a point estimate of the parameter, we initially assume the null hypothesis $H_0$ is true and use the Central Limit Theorem to determine the probability of obtaining that point estimate. If the probability is sufficiently small, we conclude that the null hypothesis $H_0$ probably is not correct and reject the null hypothesis $H_0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$H_a$: **The alternative hypothesis**: It is a claim about the population that is contradictory to null hypothesis $H_0$ and it's what we conclude when we reject then null hypothesis $H_0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the null and alternative hypotheses are contradictory, you must examine evidence to decide if you have enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis or not. The evidence is in the form of sample data.\n",
    "\n",
    "After you have determined which hypothesis the sample supports, you make a decision. There are two options for a decision. They are \"reject $H_0$\" if the sample information favors the alternative hypothesis or \"do not reject $H_0$\" or \"decline to reject $H_0$\" if the sample information is insufficient to reject the null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematical Symbols Used in $H_0$ and $H_a$:\n",
    "\n",
    "| $H_0$ | $H_a$ |\n",
    "|--|--|\n",
    "|equal ($=$) | not equal $(\\neq)$ **or** greater than ($>$) **or** less than ($<$) |\n",
    "| greater than or equal to ($\\geq$) | less than ($<$) |\n",
    "| less than or equal to ($\\leq$) | greater than ($>$) |\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** $H_0$ always has a symbol with an equal in it. $H_a$ never has a symbol with an equal in it. The choice of symbol depends on the wording of the hypothesis test. However, be aware that many researchers (including one of the co-authors in research work) use $=$ in the null hypothesis, even with $>$ or $<$ as the symbol in the alternative hypothesis. This practice is acceptable because we only make the decision to reject or not reject the null hypothesis.\n"
