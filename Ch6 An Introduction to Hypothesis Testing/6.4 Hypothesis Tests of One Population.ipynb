    "- In a **hypothesis test** problem, you may see words such as \"the level of significance is 1%.\" The \"1%\" is the preconceived or preset $\\alpha$.\n",
    "- The statistician setting up the hypothesis test selects the value of $\\alpha$ to use **before** collecting the sample data.\n",
    "- When you calculate the $p$-value and draw the picture, the $p$-value is the area in the left tail, the right tail, or split evenly between the two tails. For this reason, we call the hypothesis test left-tailed, right-tailed, or two-tailed.\n",
    "- **The alternative hypothesis,  $H_a$ , tells you if the test is left, right, or two-tailed.** It is the **key** to conducting the appropriate test.\n",
    "- $H_a$ **never** has a symbol that contains an equal sign.\n",
    "- **Thinking about the meaning of the $p$-value:** A data analyst (and anyone else) should have more confidence that he made the correct decision to reject the null hypothesis with a smaller $p$-value (for example, 0.001 as opposed to 0.04) even if using the 0.05 level for $\\alpha$. Similarly, for a large $p$-value such as 0.4, as opposed to a $p$-value of 0.056 ($\\alpha$ = 0.05 is less than either number), a data analyst should have more confidence that she made the correct decision in not rejecting the null hypothesis. This makes the data analyst use judgment rather than mindlessly applying rules.\n",
