    "## The Correlation Coefficient\n",
    "Besides looking at the scatter plot and seeing that a line seems reasonable, how can you tell if the line is a good predictor? Use the correlation coefficient as another indicator (besides the scatterplot) of the strength of the relationship between $x$ and $y$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **correlation coefficient**, $r$, developed by Karl Pearson in the early 1900s, is numerical and provides a measure of strength and direction of the linear association between the independent variable $x$ and the dependent variable $y$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can find the correlation coefficient using the <code>cor</code> function:\n",
    "\n",

    "cor(x, y)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, <code>x</code> is a list of the independent $x$ values, and <code>y</code> is the corresponding list of the dependent $y$ values.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What the VALUE of $r$ tells us:**\n",
    "- The value of $r$ is always between -1 and +1: $-1 \\leq r \\leq 1$.\n",
    "- The size of the correlation coefficient $r$ indicates the strength of the linear relationship between $x$ and $y$. Values of $r$ close to -1 or to +1 indicate a stronger linear relationship between $x$ and $y$.\n",
    "- If $r = 0$ there is likely no linear correlation. It is important to view the scatterplot, however, because data that exhibit a curved or horizontal pattern may have a correlation of 0.\n",
    "- If $r = 1$, there is perfect positive correlation. If $r = –1$, there is perfect negative correlation. In both these cases, all of the original data points lie on a straight line. Of course, in the real world, this will not generally happen.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What the SIGN of $r$ tells us:**\n",
    "- A positive value of $r$ means that when $x$ increases, $y$ tends to increase and when $x$ decreases, $y$ tends to decrease (**positive correlation**).\n",
    "- A negative value of $r$ means that when $x$ increases, $y$ tends to decrease and when $x$ decreases, $y$ tends to increase (**negative correlation**).\n",
    "- The sign of $r$ is the same as the sign of the slope, $b$, of the best-fit line."

We need to look at both the value of the correlation coefficient $r$ and the sample size $n$, together.\n",
