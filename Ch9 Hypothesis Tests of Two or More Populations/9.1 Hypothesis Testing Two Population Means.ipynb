    "## Hypothesis Test with Two Population Means\n",
    "The comparison of two population means is very common. A difference between the two samples depends on both the means and the standard deviations. Very different means can occur by chance if there is great variation among the individual samples. In order to account for the variation, we take the difference of the sample means,  $\\overline{D} = \\overline{X}_1 - \\overline{X}_2$, and divide by the standard error in order to standardize the difference. The result is a $t$-score test statistic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because we do not know the population standard deviations, we estimate them using the two sample standard deviations from our independent samples. For the hypothesis test, we calculate the estimated standard deviation, or **standard error**, of **the difference in sample means**,  $\\overline{D} = \\overline{X}_1 - \\overline{X}_2$.\n",
