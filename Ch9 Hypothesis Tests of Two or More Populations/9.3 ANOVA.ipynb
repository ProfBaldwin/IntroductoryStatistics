    "## Introduction to ANOVA\n",
    "\n",
    "ANOVA stands for ANalysis Of VAriance. An ANOVA test is a hypothesis test used to compare the means among several populations. The test uses variances to help determine if the population means are equal or not. To perform a one-way ANOVA test, the following basic assumptions must be fulfilled:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each population is normally distributed.\n",
    "- All samples are randomly selected and independent.\n",
    "- The populations have equal variances (or standard deviations).\n",
    "\n",
    "The null hypothesis is that all the population means are the same. The alternative hypothesis is that at least one pair of means is different. For example, if there are k populations:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "&H_0:\\mu_1 = \\mu_2 = \\mu_3 = \\cdots = \\mu_k \\\\\n",
    "&H_a: \\text{At least one mean isn't equal to all the other means}\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "ANOVA works by comparing the approximate variance *between* the samples (that is, how much the samples vary with each other) with the approximate variance *within* the samples (that is, how much on average each sample varies on its own). If the null hypothesis is true so that the population means are all equal, then the variance between the samples and the variance within the samples should be about equal."
